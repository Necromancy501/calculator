Hi! This is the last assignment for the TOP's Foundations Course. For this assignment
I was tasked and prompted to do a calculator using everything I've learnt so far.
This is, essentially, reinventing the wheel. For this I decided to wander away from
the prompt and reconnect to my own experiences using a calculator, which is why this deployment
has some unique features that might not be present in other solutions like the
double action buttons, double display and parenthesis handling.

This is, all in all, an atomic calculator. It can't perform complex operations and
scientific operations but it can do daily calculations in very few button presses. I
decided not to implement keyboard handling because first and foremost I've already spent
lots of time in this project and last but not least I want the user to experience the calculator
using the intended buttons. I want the user to have fun and rediscover math with this.

Thank you so much for everything!
